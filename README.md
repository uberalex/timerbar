#TimerBar
Super-simple OSX bar applet that counts down from a set interval and notifies.

Uses rumps as the library: <https://github.com/tito/rumps>

Uses parsedatetime for custom timer: <https://github.com/bear/parsedatetime>

Uses icons from <http://icons8.com/icons/>, who generously offer them for free in exchange for a link!

To Create a standalone app, ensure you have py2app installed and use:

    python setup.py py2app

the resulting app is in the dist directory
